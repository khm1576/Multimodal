# Multimodal

This repository contains code used in our research on predicting glaucoma risk using multiple data modalities, including:

- Glaucoma PRS (Polygenic Risk Scores)
- IDP-based Genetic Scores (IGSs)
- Imaging-derived Deep Learning Scores (IDS)

The goal of this project is to combine genetic, imaging, and deep learning features to better understand and predict glaucoma.
